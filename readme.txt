Easy way to insert social sharing links into your WordPress posts/pages via shortcodes. 

== Description ==

A tiny and simple hackable plugin to insert lightweight social sharing links into your post/page content via shortcodes. You can use `[tinysocial_all]` shortcode to add links to all the networks at once, or individual codes, like `[facebook]`, `[twitter]`, etc. to insert links to individual networks.

Currently supported networks are:
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google+
* Pinterest
* Linked In
* Buffer
* Digg
* StumbleUpon
* Tumblr
* Reddit
* Delicious

An enormous amount of coffee was consumed while developing these plugins, so if you like what you get, please consider treating me to a [cup](http://arunas.co/#coffee). Or two. Or ten.

Also, try out my other plugins:

* [Gust](http://tiny.lt/gust) - a Ghost-like admin panel for WordPress, featuring Markdown based split-view editor.
* [tinyCoffee](http://tiny.lt/tinycoffee) - a PayPal donations button with a twist. Ask people to treat you to a coffee/beer/etc. 
* [tinyTOC](http://tiny.lt/tinytoc) - automatic Table of Contents, based on H1-H6 headings in post content.
* [tinyIP](http://tiny.lt/tinyip) - *Premium* - stop WordPress users from sharing login information, force users to be logged in only from one device at a time.

1. Upload `tinysocial` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add another network? =

Sure, you can use `tinysocial_networks` filter to add more networks.

= What are the shortcodes that I can use? =

* `[tinysocial_all]` displays a list of all active networks. This shortcode accepts two attributes - `separator` and `last`, for example: `[tinysocial_all separator="|" last=" or "]`. Please note spaces around `or`;
* `[facebook]`, `[twitter]` etc. - for every social network. You can change link text by adding content to the shortcode, for example `[facebook]FB[/facebook]`.
